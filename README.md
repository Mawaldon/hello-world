# hello-world
Hey there it's Marcus. I've been heavily enamored with computers since about the age of 7 and have finally decided to the nose dive
of learning code I started myself off heavily with java code and have recently discovered what a full stack developer is.
I'm in the process of branching out from writing the middle java code and am teaching myself sql as well as javascript and html.
Hopefully throughout this process I can learn many things and acheive my long term job of landing a job in the industry.
The main languages I want to be fluent on are SQL,Ruby(on rails),Java,C++,Html,javascript.
Knowing all of these languages should be able to make me a full stack developer once I can figure out how they all interact with each
other. From my understanding now SQL is more background for collecting data; Java, C++, and Ruby are more middle ground which execute
algorithms or sets of conditions to produce desired results; and lastly but not least Html and javascript are more foreground which
due mainly user interactions and collect data from users to store in the database or send to java programs. Although in Android/
Mobile platforms the front end isnt really used the user is directly interacting with the Java/C++/Ruby program and its all being
handled via the program.
